ContractMissions

ContractMissions brings dynamic, replayable contract jobs to GTA V, offering a fast-paced mix of heists, chases, ambushes, raids, and high-risk takedowns. Every contract spawns naturally around the map and can also be triggered instantly by the player, creating a seamless experience that feels fully integrated into the world of Los Santos.

Take on VIP assassinations, highway hijacks, gang territory raids, cargo truck robberies, special destruction contracts, and more. Each mission features escalating danger, police response, timers, and a payout system that rewards skill, speed, and consistency. Whether you're hunting high-value VIPs or stealing exotic vehicles under pressure, every contract delivers action, challenge, and endless replayability.

ContractMissions includes eight unique mission types, each with its own gameplay loop. Police reinforcements engage dynamically, SWAT units protect high-value targets, and drop-off locations vary each run. Payouts scale based on vehicle condition, distance, wanted level, and your success streak — encouraging clean execution and fast escapes.

Created by EclipseModding, ContractMissions is built for ScriptHookVDotNet and installs easily into your GTA V scripts folder. It loads automatically when the game starts and adds fresh content for Story Mode players who want more excitement, risk, and reward.

📥 How to Install ContractMissions (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Download ContractMissions

Download the ContractMissions ZIP from the Releases page.

2️⃣ Open the ZIP file

Inside it, open the folder named EclipseModding.

3️⃣ Copy the script files

From the EclipseModding folder, copy:
• ContractMissions.dll
• LemonUI.SHVDN3.dll
• LemonUI.SHVDN3.pdb

4️⃣ Create a scripts folder (if needed)

Go to your GTA V installation directory.
If you do not see a folder named scripts, create one.

Grand Theft Auto V → scripts

6️⃣ Install ScriptHookV

Open the ScriptHookV folder from the ZIP.
Copy ScriptHookV.dll and dinput8.dll.

7️⃣ Paste ScriptHookV files into your GTA game folder

Paste them directly into your main GTA V directory — the same location as GTA5.exe.
(These do not go in the scripts folder.)
