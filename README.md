ContractMissions

ContractMissions brings dynamic, replayable contract jobs to GTA V, offering a fast-paced mix of heists, chases, ambushes, raids, and high-risk takedowns. Every contract spawns naturally around the map and can also be triggered instantly by the player, creating a seamless experience that feels integrated into the world of Los Santos.

Take on VIP assassinations, highway hijacks, gang territory raids, cargo truck robberies, special destruction contracts, and more. Each mission features escalating danger, police response, timers, and a payout system that rewards skill, speed, and consistency. Whether you’re hunting high-value VIPs or stealing exotic vehicles under pressure, every contract delivers action, challenge, and replayability.

ContractMissions includes eight unique mission types, each with its own gameplay loop. Police reinforcements engage dynamically, SWAT units protect high-value targets, and drop-off locations vary each run. Payouts scale based on vehicle condition, distance, wanted level, and your success streak, encouraging clean execution and fast escapes.

Created by EclipseModding, ContractMissions is built for ScriptHookVDotNet and installs easily into your GTA V scripts folder. It runs automatically on game launch and integrates smoothly with single-player gameplay, offering fresh content and endless replay value for Story Mode players.
