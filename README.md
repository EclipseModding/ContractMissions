ContractMissions

ContractMissions brings dynamic, replayable contract jobs to GTA V, offering a fast-paced mix of heists, chases, ambushes, raids, and high-risk takedowns. Every contract spawns naturally around the map and can be triggered instantly by the player, creating a seamless experience that feels integrated into the world of Los Santos.

Take on VIP assassinations, highway hijacks, gang territory raids, cargo truck robberies, special destruction contracts, and more. Each mission features escalating danger, police response, timers, and a payout system that rewards skill, speed, and consistency. Whether you’re hunting high-value VIPs or stealing exotic cars under pressure, every contract delivers action, challenge, and replayability.

ContractMissions includes eight unique mission types, each with its own gameplay loop. Police reinforcements engage dynamically, SWAT appears in high-value missions, and drop-off points vary each run. Payouts scale based on vehicle condition, distance, wanted level, and your active success streak, encouraging clean execution and fast escapes.

Created by EclipseModding, ContractMissions is built for ScriptHookVDotNet and installs easily into your GTA V scripts folder. It runs automatically on game launch and integrates smoothly with the single-player world. Whether you want new content, more chaos, or a reason to return to Story Mode, ContractMissions delivers a full contract-style experience with endless replay value.
